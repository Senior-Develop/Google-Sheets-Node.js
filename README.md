# Google Sheets + Node.js APP
Simple Node.js/Express app (with EJS frontend) that integrates with Google Sheets to read/update data. This application demos the functionality with a simple "Video Request" app

## Setup
You need to add a file to the root of this project called "credentials.json". You can find a guide on how to do this in my YouTube tutorial above.

Then run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Run locally (port 1337)
Run `nodemon index.js`
